## Hello there

We're developing a fork of [WebVOWL](https://github.com/VisualDataWeb/WebVOWL), which we hope may become the next step towards WebVOWL 2.0.

Our new WebVOWL comes in two flavours: [WebVOWL Rust](https://github.com/WebVOWL/WebVOWL-Rust) and [WebVOWL Legacy](https://github.com/WebVOWL/WebVOWL-Legacy)
